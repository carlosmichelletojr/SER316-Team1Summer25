Ralph was having dinner with Trisha until he was distracted by the hund across the street. 
The hund was ravishing a Bratwurst with great German feircity, as this city was known for.
Trisha managed to regain Ralph's attention confused as to what he was talking about as they were at a Ratskeller.
"Sorry,” Ralph said, wiping his mouth, “but if that dog eats one more like that, he’s getting a one-way ticket out from Flughafen.”
Trisha sighed, muttering something about getting dessert, and wandered toward a nearby Bäckerei filled with the smell of fresh Gebäck.
